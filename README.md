My Users is a users directory app. It fetches users from a mock API and then you can access every user details.
This project is a POC of RxSwift via MVVM design pattern. The implementation of all the UI elements is done by code: no Storyboard, xib,... - I know it looks ugly -. It focuces more on the logic and achritecture behind the scenes. 


# Used Libraries :

* RxSwift, obviously :bowtie:
* Alamofire : Manage network calls
* Kingfisher : Manage images downloading & caching 
* ObjectMapper : Easy Model / JSON mapping
